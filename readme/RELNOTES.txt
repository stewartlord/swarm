    and code review for teams using Perforce that will help your teams ship
    quality software faster.

    This document lists all user-visible changes to Perforce Swarm for
    Release 2016.1

    Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCC, e.g. 2016.1/123456. YYYY is the
    year; R is the release of that year; CCCCC is the bug fix change level.
    Each bug fix in these release notes is marked by its change number.
    Any release includes (1) all bug fixes of all previous releases and (2)
    all bug fixes of the current release up to the bug fix change level.

Documentation

    Swarm Release 2016.1 documentation is included in the distribution
    under the "public/docs" folder and can be accessed from within the
    Swarm from the "Help" menu on the toolbar once logged in.

    Additionally, the documentation is available online:

    * http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/swarm

Supported Client Browsers

    Swarm supports the following client web browsers and versions:

    * Apple Safari 5.1+
    * Google Chrome 33+ (stable channel)
    * Microsoft Internet Explorer 9+
    * Mozilla Firefox 28+

    We recommend the use of the latest stable version of the browsers
    listed above for the best experience when using Swarm.

    Other web browsers might also work, including prior, development or
    beta builds of the above web browsers, but are not officially
    supported.

    Swarm requires that JavaScript and cookies are enabled in the web
    browser.

Installation and Supported Platforms

    Please see the separate "install" file, a peer to this file.

Upgrading from Prior Versions

    Please see the separate "upgrade" file, a peer to this file.

License

    Please see the separate "license" file, a peer to this file.

Known Limitations

    Access Control

        Older versions of the Perforce Server (before 2013.1/659207) lack
        the 'dm.keys.hide' configuration setting. Swarm stores much of its
        metadata in keys in Perforce (e.g. comments, activity, projects).
        By default these keys can be read from and written to by any user
        with review access.

        If using a new enough server, run 'p4 configure set dm.keys.hide=2'
        to require admin access to read and write keys.

    Task Stream Reviews

        Pre-commit reviews in a task stream are not yet supported.

Major new functionality in 2016.1

    #1349976, #1354369, #1359795, #1363946, #1365396, #1369116, #1371461,
    #1372479, #1372656, #1372707, #1373228, #1374179, #1374273, #1375065,

    #1379330, #1383350, #1385018, #1385382 (Bugs #84966, #84967, #84968,
    #84969, #84971, #84974, #84975, #84976, #84977, #84978, #84979,

    #86059, #86121, #86131, #86232, #86263, #86274, #86372, #86449)
        Added support for managing user groups in Swarm.

        You can now view, list, search, add, edit and delete groups.
        Each group can have notifications enabled so that members
        of the group get emails anytime another member of the group
        creates a review or commits a change.

        When viewing a group you may see activity performed by any member
        of the group and reviews created by any member of the group.

        When listing groups, groups that you own or are a member of
        appear first, groups with notifications enabled appear second
        and lastly, groups are ordered by name.

    #1334616, #1334641, #1334707, #1334746, #1336388, #1336866, #1363026,
    #1365608, #1368601, #1380898 (Bugs #84462, #85188, #85402, #85411)
        Users can like comments. At the bottom of each comment Swarm now
        displays the number of likes and a heart icon. The icon can be
        clicked to 'like' the comment.

        When a comment is liked, Swarm records the activity and sends an
        email notification to the author of the comment.

    #1325760, #1330654, #1338383, #1349339, #1353543, #1353982, #1354643,
    #1356548, #1356781, #1359595, #1363405, #1374135, #1374751, #1374758,
    #1375435, #1375931, #1377876, #1378137, #1379283, #1383321, #1383679,
    #1385021, #1385190 (Bugs #76774, #84359, #84458, #84852, #85003,
    #85010, #85129, #85307, #85391, #85492, #85537, #85570, #85620,
    #86060, #86119, #86225, #86350)
        Added version 2 of the RESTful API (ie. /api/v2/).

        Version 2 adds the following functionality: list activity, list
        groups, fetch a group, create a group, update a group, delete a
        group, fetch a project, create a project, update a project,
        delete a project, transition a review and commit a review.

Minor new functionality in 2016.1

    #1382157 (Bug #84535)
        Improved performance for the Swarm blame button. Using a 20,000
        line test file, this change reduces the rendering time from
        ~60s to ~2s in Firefox and Chrome. Internet Explorer 10 improves
        from ~730s to ~8s.

    #1380885 (Bug #86341)
        Swarm now requires users to be logged in by default.
        To restore the previous behavior edit config.php and set
        array('security' => array('require_login' => false))

    #1379290 (Bug #84420)
        Added a "My Reviews" dropdown button to the Reviews page. This
        allows reviews to be filtered by those that you authored or those
        that you are participating in.

    #1374066 (Bug #86011)
        Added an option to disable Swarm's auto-registration of the
        P4.Swarm.URL property. The new option can be set in config.php:
        array('p4' => array('auto_register_url' => false))

    #1372999 (Bug #81339)
        The X-Frame-Options header is now configurable. This header
        controls when Swarm can be embedded in frames. To disable the
        header edit config.php and set:
        array('security' => array('x_frame_options' => false))

    #1368888, #1372690 (Bugs #85380, #85542, #86050)
        Improved performance with large numbers of users or groups.
        Testing with 10000 users and a comment thread with 100 comments,
        page load times were reduced from 7s to 250ms.

    #1361367 (Bug #86519)
        Updated language files for JA, KO and ZH.

    #1356521 (Bug #85314)
        Renamed config options for adding projects to be more consistent
        with other options. Existing settings are still honored.
        The 'security -> add_project_admin_only' option becomes
        'projects -> add_admin_only'. The 'security -> add_project_groups'
        becomes 'projects -> add_groups_only'.

    #1351847, #1352325, #1352326, #1356409 (Bug #81285)
        Updated the precompiled P4PHP binaries that come with Swarm to
        use P4API 2015.2/1340214.

    #1323467 (Bug #77725)
        To assist with troubleshooting email configuration problems Swarm
        now logs successful emails at the DEBUG log level.

    #1321796 (Bug #84384)
        Updated the project toolbar to look more modern.

Bugs fixed in 2016.1 Patch 1 (since 2016.1/1386839)

    #1399779 (Bug #87077)
        Fixed an XSS vulnerability where labels in search results were
        not being escaped correctly.

    #1398683, #1398909, #1399266, #1399692, #1400199 (Bugs #86663,
    #86950, #87024)
        Fixed multiple vulnerabilities involving symlinks. The system now
        refuses to preview, archive or delete the target of symlinks.
        Previously, symlinks could be abused to disclose data or remove
        files on the Swarm server that the user does not have permission
        to access.

        Note: The archive feature now requires the 'zip' command.
        Support for PHP's 'zip' extension has been removed. If the 'zip'
        command cannot be found, the archive button will not appear.

    #1394659 (Bug #86805)
        Fixed an XSS vulnerability where HTML in project descriptions was
        not being escaped correctly on the home page.

Bugs fixed in 2016.1

    #1380942, #1381570, #1384005 (Bug #85965)
        Fixed a bug that could produce two reviews for a single change
        under certain conditions. If a review was created using both the
        '#review' keyword and via the P4V integration, there was a race
        condition that could result in two reviews being created.

        Now Swarm temporarily locks each change before starting a new
        review. These locks are Swarm specific and only limit the creation
        of reviews.

    #1372509 (Bug #85872)
        Fixed a minor issue where double-clicking on project settings
        checkboxes could cause the checkbox to become out of sync with
        the form.

    #1365277 (Bug #84965)
        Fixed a bug where links to users in search results did not work
        for usernames that contained backslashes.

    #1359574 (Bugs #80107, #85454)
        Fixed a bug where ZIP downloads did not work on pending files.

    #1359011 (Bug #85423)
        Fixed a problem where URLs with no TLD were not linkified.
        Swarm no longer requires a TLD in the hostname to linkify a URL.

    #1355979 (Bug #81600)
        Reduced the severity of Basic Authentication failures to 'debug'.
        This should reduce noise in the log file.

    #1352055 (Bug #76075)
        Fixed an issue where the buttons on an archived comment could
        become hard to click if the window was too narrow.

    #1350832, #1351299 (Bug #85191)
        Fixed a bug where the user dropdown menu could be partially
        hidden behind the header on some pages.

    #1350733 (Bug #85176)
        Fixed a bug where the branch moderators tooltip on the project
        settings page did not correctly list moderators.

    #1349386 (Bug #84995)
        Fixed a 500 error that could occur when viewing a user's shelved
        changes if 'dm.keys.hide' was set and the current user was not an
        administrator.

    #1338808 (Bug #84906)
        Fixed a bug that caused the jobs search to throw an exception for
        queries that start with '^' (not).

    #1327917 (Bug #84622)
        Fixed a problem where the test status of a review was not updated
        if the tests were re-run without making any changes to the review.

    #1327209, #1327378 (Bug #84629)
        Fixed a problem that could occur with existing cache files when
        upgrading Swarm. We now verify that the schema in the cached
        objects matches the current schema.

    #1318968, #1330724 (Bug #84650)
        Fixed a bug where the common path was not being displayed for
        shelved changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2015.4

    #1308891, #1308998, #1309707, #1310199 (Bug #63187)
        Users can now add groups as project members. All members of these
        groups (or any of their subgroups) become members of the project.
        Any changes to these groups are automatically reflected in the
        project. This is designed to ease user management.

    #1308890 (Bug #71597)
        You can now diff arbitrary versions of a review. Previously you
        were limited to comparing consecutive versions of a review. The
        version slider can be pulled apart to span a range of versions.
        If you grab the connector then both version markers will move in
        lockstep.

    #1307207, #1308095 (Bug #78222)
        Added packages for RHEL/CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 14.04.

    #1265420, #1308568, #1309189 (Bug #66264)
        The user's profile page now has a tab for shelved changes.
        This makes it easier to request reviews of shelved changes
        or to see the review status of changes that are in progress.

Minor new functionality in 2015.4

    #1309162, #1309659, #1309729 (Bug #77809)
        Introduced a button to show whitespace characters (space and tab)
        in diff output. When enabled these characters appear as muted dots
        and arrows respectively.

    #1255119 (Bug #84195)
        Added support for previewing the Keynote, Pages and Numbers
        document formats via the LibreOffice module.

Bugs fixed in 2015.4 Patch 1 (since 2015.4/1317923)

    #1326721 (Bug #84612)
        Fixed a regression where projects could not be added on Perforce
        Servers older than 2012.1.

    #1326575 (Bug #70714)
        Fixed a problem affecting edge/commit server deployments. If Swarm
        was configured to talk directly to an edge server, reviews created
        by that instance of Swarm could not be updated. This is because
        the change was being bound to the edge server. Now, edge server
        instances forward review creation to the commit server instance.

    #1322454 (Bug #84108)
        Fixed a bug where the user picker could list groups for fields
        that do not allow groups to be selected (e.g. Project Owners).

Bugs fixed in 2015.4

    #1316264 (Bug #84197)
        Fixed a bug in the Perl trigger where posting to Swarm could
        fail on Windows Perforce Servers. This would only occur when
        wget was installed but curl was not.

    #1307838 (Bug #83660)
        Fixed a bug where links in RSS feeds did not work in some feed
        readers. RSS feeds now use the fully qualified Swarm URL.

    #1306055 (Bug #83608)
        Fixed a bug introduced by the 'edit_branches_admin_only'
        option. When enabled, this feature unintentionally restricted
        editing of projects to administrators.

    #1265682 (Bug #83602)
        Fixed a bug in the Perl trigger script where the strict check
        erroneously prevented committing a review in some cases.
        Specifically: reviews with a single file marked for delete and
        reviews with moved files.

    #1265015 (Bug #83589)
        Fixed an issue where Swarm did not recognize the new utf8 file
        type as text and therefore failed to render diffs and previews.

    #1262908 (Bug #77369)
        Fixed a bug where +l files were silently dropped from reviews.
        Note this fix requires Perforce Server version 2014.2 or newer
        with the filetype.bypasslock server configurable enabled.

    #1261960 (Bug #83277)
        Fixed a performance problem that could occur if the .git-fusion
        depot contained changes with more than 10k files.

    #1255309 (Bug #84196)
        Adjusted the styling of text file previews so that the page
        does not shift around when syntax highlighting large files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2015.3

    #1241320 (Bug #66921)
        Enhanced the Perl trigger to run under Windows. There is now a
        single trigger script for all supported server platforms.

    #1239352 (Bug #70542)
        Introduced a search box that looks for projects, users and files.

        A search input now appears in the top-right of the toolbar and
        searches as you type. Results are grouped by type. It looks for
        projects, users and files that match your keywords. Project and
        user searches use Swarm's cache. File searches use 'p4 fstat'
        and P4 Search (if it is installed).

    #1230860, #1240881 (Bug #64899)
    	Email notifications for review comments can now be delayed and sent
        in a single batch email later. The add comment form now has a
        'Delay Notification' checkbox. When a new comment is posted with
        this box checked, the email notification is delayed until a comment
        is posted with the box unchecked.

Minor new functionality in 2015.3

    #1241441 (Bug #79003)
        Added a PHP 5.6 build of P4PHP. All P4PHP builds have now been
        updated to use P4API 2015.1/1240625

    #1241268 (Bug #81066)
        Updated to the new hex-shaped Swarm logo.

    #1237763, #1239247 (Bug #77648)
        The 'My Reviews' button now filters reviews to show only those
        authored by the current user.

        Added a new author filter to the list reviews API endpoint
        (GET /api/v1.2/reviews). This bumps the version for all endpoints
        to v1.2.

    #1231387, #1231395 (Bug #78004)
        The project sidebar now displays owners and moderators.

    #1229476, #1230017, #1230262, #1230490 (Bug #80185)
        The test status tooltip now shows when the results were reported.
        Internally, Swarm now tracks the start time and average running
        duration for automated tests.

    #1219887 (Bug #80322)
        Improved handling of multiple or out-of-order test results.
        Previously the last result would win. Now results for old versions
        are rejected and we preserve the results of the first failure
        if we receive multiple results for a given version of a review.

    #1215329 (Bug #81449)
        We now show a hard-disk icon for depots when browsing the root of
        a server (previously depots were represented with a folder icon).

    #1214788 (Bug #81450)
        Moved the logout link to the bottom of the user dropdown menu.

Bugs fixed in 2015.3

    #1241158, #1247062 (Bug #81061)
        Fixed a bug where sub-groups that reference parent groups caused
        infinite recursion and exhausted all memory.

    #1240050 (Bug #81042)
        Fixed a bug where the Perl trigger script could emit a 'Use of
        uninitialized value' error when the config file was not specified.

    #1235955, #1236887 (Bug #80784)
        Fix a bug where file downloads were not always streamed resulting
        in excessive memory consumption. This was due to output being
        double buffered in some cases. We now clear all output buffers
        when streaming output.

    #1231393 (Bug #81458)
        Fixed a bug where the number of moderators was not being displayed
        next to each branch on the project edit form.

    #1230829 (Bug #80351)
        Fixed a 404 that could occur when marking a file as read when
        diffing two versions of a review if the file was previously shelved
        and had since been removed from the review.

    #1230827 (Bug #80538)
        Fixed an illegal offset warning that could occur when diffing two
        versions of a review. This would happen if a file that existed in
        the earlier shelved version of the review was removed in the later
        version.

    #1228298 (Bug #80404)
        Fixed a regression bug where the follow project link did not work.

    #1225869 (Bug #80501)
        Fixed a layout issue that occurred if the text input for inline
        comments was resized horizontally. Now the text input can only
        be resized vertically.

    #1220502, #1220960, #1222664 (Bug #77401)
        Fixed problems that affected the extensibility of the Linkify
        filter. The last word variable is now updated and passed
        correctly to Linkify callbacks.

    #1216034, #1235980, #1241414 (Bug #80348)
        Pending comments are now preserved when comments are refreshed
        while editing a comment or adding a comment from the comments tab.

Major new functionality in 2015.2

    #1071421, #1203684, #1204593, #1206600, #1207516, #1207537 (Bug #64896)
        Comments are now editable. If you are logged in as the user that
        authored a comment, you will now see an 'Edit' link in the comment
        footer. Clicking this link presents an in-place edit form that
        allows modification of the comment body and attachments.

    #1206282, #1207388 (Bugs #79595, #79596)
        Added localizations for Simplified Chinese and Korean.

        Incoming JA, KO, and ZH-CN localizations from AlphaCRC, along with
        changes to the assembleLocaleData.php script to process the new
        languages.

    #1100113, #1205196, #1206305, #1206658, #1331177 (Bugs #70714, #79174)
        Added support for multi-site deployments. Swarm is now compatible
        with edge and commit servers. Use of the new Perl-based trigger
        is required.

    #1099584, #1101368 (Bugs #75355, #75653, #76342, #77572)
        Added a new version of the Swarm trigger implemented in Perl.
        The usage of this trigger is compatible with the existing bash
        trigger. The new version of the trigger adds support for edge
        servers and fixes a bug with the strict enforcement mode and ktext
        files.

Minor new functionality in 2015.2

    #1212292 (Bug #80033)
        Updated the Swarm trigger package to use the new Perl trigger.

    #1207511 (Bug #79934)
        Changed the subject for change submit email notifications from
        'Change @54321' to 'Commit @54321'.

    #1206503, #1207071 (Bug #78167)
        IP protections emulation now includes proxy rules. Previously,
        proxy rules were not taken into account. Now, we treat Swarm
        as an intermediary and apply proxy rules according to the end
        user's IP address.

    #1206494 (Bug #78996)
        Added an option to limit configuration of project branches to
        admin users. With the projects > edit_branches_admin_only option
        set to true, only admins are able to configure branches.

    #1205521, #1205762 (Bug #72454)
        We now list jobs and changed files in review email notifications.

    #1204727, #1207016 (Bugs #78995, #78996)
        Added an option to limit editing project names to admin users.
        With the projects > edit_name_admin_only option set to true, only
        admins are able to rename projects.

    #1202977 (Bug #79396)
        Added an option to the Swarm trigger to skip the enforce and strict
        checks if the change only contains files of the specified type(s).
        File types to skip can be specified via the EXEMPT_EXTENSIONS
        config option.

    #1202975 (Bug #79609)
        Moderators now receive email notification for commits and reviews
        against branches they moderate even if they are not members of the
        affected projects.

    #1198459, #1198806, #1206279 (Bug #79295)
        Refreshed the login page. Added a nice background image of some
        fine folks having coffee and doing important creative work.

    #1197879, #1197890, #1198475 (Bug #66465)
        Moved the project edit button to the project toolbar and renamed it
        to 'Settings'. Tweaked the project form to render with the project
        toolbar and sidebar when editing.

    #1171636 (Bug #70542)
        Swarm now generates host-unlocked tickets on login. This is needed
        to integrate with other Perforce services like p4-search.

    #1171629 (Bug #79944)
        Tweaked line hash handling (ie. #l123) to position the targeted
        line 1/4 of the way down the page. Previously it was positioned
        100px down the page which often felt too high.

    #1149485 (Bug #78994)
        Added an option to the Swarm trigger to skip the enforce and strict
        checks if the change contains more than a given number of files.
        The number of files can be specified via the new EXEMPT_FILE_COUNT
        config option.

    #1126994, #1144472, #1206760 (Bug #79386)
        Fixed a performance problem that could occur with large numbers
        of users, groups and projects. With 5000 users, 5000 groups and
        500 projects load times for the project listing have been reduced
        by >20x.

    #1099546, #1100888, #1101371, #1101414 (Bug #79315)
        Simplified the email notification template. The revised template
        eliminates the grey border and reduces margins.

    #1072284, #1197886 (Bug #79214)
        Renamed the 'History' tab and 'History' links to 'Commits'.

    #1071674, #1073354 (Bug #79203)
        Comment counts now reflect the number of open (non-archived)
        comments. Hovering over the number of comments shows the number
        of archived comments. Previously we only showed the total number
        of comments for a given topic.

    #1069597 (Bug #79182)
        Improved the visibility of 'more context' rows. We now render a
        horizontal grey line help delineate diff chunks.

    #1068547, #1209330 (Bug #73003)
        Updated rules for review transitions to optionally deny authors
        approving their own reviews. If the reviews > disable_self_approve
        option is true, then authors are not able to approve their own
        reviews (even if they are also moderators).

    #1067114 (Bug #76362)
        Imagick module now converts ".tif" files. Previously, only the
        ".tiff" extension was recognized.

Bugs fixed in 2015.2

    #1214397 (Bug #80087)
        Fixed a problem where Swarm could continuously reload a review if
        it had unexpected commit-status data (due to a race condition).

    #1208398 (Bug #76535)
        Fixed a bug where OVA setup script did not work with SSL enabled
        Perforce servers.

    #1207465 (Bug #79269)
        Fixed a bug where our handling of Emojis was not compatible with
        newer versions of Gemoji.

    #1207464 (Bug #79856)
        Fixed a bug where some of our 'infinitely scrolling' lists were not
        loading more items. At some zoom levels Chrome reported a lower
        than expected scroll position. This caused our code to conclude the
        user had not reached the bottom of the page. Now we consider the
        user to have scrolled to the bottom if they are within a couple of
        pixels.

    #1206727 (Bug #79800)
        Fixed a bug where attempting to archive a specific version of a
        file resulted in a 500 error.

    #1205188 (Bug #79945)
        Fixed an issue where the project save button could be erroneously
        enabled if a project name is entered and user data has not yet
        loaded (despite having no project members).

    #1152722, #1205188 (Bug #79945)
        Fixed a bug where the project save button could be enabled when
        it should be disabled. Specifically, this could occur when the
        list of users had not yet loaded, or while waiting to redirect
        to a newly created or updated project page.

    #1066846 (Bugs #74987, #76629)
        Fixed a bug where file and directory names could be missing
        characters if they contained non-ascii bytes and the web-server
        was using to a non-UTF-8 locale.

        We now detect the available system locales and explicitly select
        one that supports UTF-8.

    #1065005 (Bug #78165)
        Fixed a bug where notification emails were not threading properly
        in Microsoft Outlook. Outlook uses a non-standard 'Thread-Index'
        header to group 'conversations' and Swarm was not sending this
        header.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2015.1

    #1024336, #1027042, #1035289, #1035631, #1039648 (Bug #66715)
        Added support for localization. User-facing strings now run
        through a translation component that supports string replacement,
        escapement and pluralization. The default and fallback locales can
        be set in the configuration file. The user's locale is detected
        from the browser's HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE header automatically
        (this behavior can be disabled).

        Both the web browser and the web server support translation.
        The same methods are available in each environment and behave
        in the same way. The same messages are available in both
        contexts and whichever locale is configured or detected on
        the server will be selected in the browser.

    #993239, #1003694, #1029826, #1034069, #1038235 (Bug #71596)
        Files and folders can now be downloaded as ZIP archives.
        Any depot path can be archived, however, it must not be larger
        than the archives => 'max_input_size' setting. The default value
        for this setting is 512 MB.

        Archives are built in the background and a progress bar is
        presented to the user as files are synced and compressed.
        Each archive is cached for 12 hours (by default) before being
        erased. This ensures that subsequent requests to download the
        same archive go quickly.

        The archives => 'archive_timeout' setting controls how long
        a process can spend building a ZIP archive (default is 30m).

    #1034946, #1035427, #1039713 (Bugs #66965, #77519)
        We now limit the number of files displayed in a changelist.
        Previously if you viewed a particularly large change (many
        thousands of files) Swarm might run out of memory. Now limit
        the number of files displayed to 1000 (by default). This can be
        adjusted via the p4 => 'max_changelist_files' setting.

        If the P4D server is 2014.1+ the number of files will be limited
        in Perforce. Otherwise they will be limited in Swarm. In the
        latter case, Swarm can still run out of memory on large changes.
        However, the threshold has been raised because the list of files
        is trimmed fairly early.

Minor new functionality in 2015.1

    #1038843 (Bug #77610)
        Enhanced JIRA integration to better find references to issues
        when they are surrounded by punctuation. Specifically, Swarm
        now detects JIRA issues that are wrapped in round brackets '()'
        and curly braces '{}'.

    #1033167 (Bug #78159)
        Improved the XHProf module to automatically clean-up old report
        files. Previously if XHProf was enabled, the number of log files
        would continue to grow over time. Due to their large size these
        files could end up consuming a significant amount of disk space.

        Note: XHProf is a profiler developed by Facebook.

    #1011531 (Bug #77468)
        Added a reviews => 'commit_timeout' setting to provide control
        over how long processes can spend submitting files to Perforce.
        By default this is set to 30 minutes.

    #1006502 (Bug #67720)
        We now detect errors connecting to Perforce and report them as 503
        (service unavailable). This should assist in debugging p4 port,
        user and password problems.

    #1003872, #1005554 (Bug #78347)
        Minor visual refresh. User avatars now appear rounded. Rows in
        tables no longer appear with alternating background colors.
        These changes are purely aesthetic.

    #1001768, #1006500 (Bug #77277)
        Added a notice to the top of the home page if there are no
        workers running. This should assist in debugging a common server
        configuration problem.

    #991098 (Bug #76671)
        Improved the rules governing review state transitions. Authors
        are now permitted to approve or reject their own reviews if they
        are branch moderators.

Bugs fixed in 2015.1

    #1039199 (Bug #74656)
        Fixed an issue where version 1.1 of the web-services API added
        a new required reviewers field and erroneously made it available
        to version 1.0 of the API. We no longer accept required reviewers
        on v1.0.

    #1035544, #1035560 (Bug #66917)
        Fixed an issue that can cause a commit to be partially processed.
        In some cases if a user unshelved files in a review and one or
        more of those files had pending resolves, Swarm would be unable to
        remove files from the review and would abort processing the commit.

        If the server version is 2014.2+, we now use the -f flag to ensure
        that we are able to remove shelved files. Additionally, we ignore
        the error that will occur if this situation arises on an older
        version of P4D.

    #1033935 (Bug #78332)
        The blame button is now disabled for files that have no content.
        Previously an error would occur if blame was used on an empty file.

    #1022486 (Bug #76571)
        Fixed javascript error occurring when switching to History tab
        while viewing a file in Swarm.

    #1022324 (Bug #77803)
        Removed legacy rewrite rules for adding tasks to the queue.

        These rules were left there temporarily for backwards
        compatibility. Currently, the tasks are added to the queue via
        posting to http://<swarm-host>/queue/add/<swarm-token> that has a
        separate rewrite rule.

    #1019647 (Bug #77678)
        Fixed a bug where the swarm-trigger's optional 'strict' and
        'enforce' modes did not work against a unicode enabled server.

    #1016421 (Bug #71596)
        Fixed an issue where progress bar status text was not legible until
        the bar was at least as wide as the text. Now the text appears in
        black over the background and white over the finished portion of
        the progress bar.

    #1011943 (Bug #78436)
        Fixed a performance regression where the projects sidebar could
        take a long time to load. This was most prominent when there was
        a bad link between Swarm and the Perforce server. In some cases,
        the projects sidebar now loads 8x faster.

    #1006678 (Bug #77394)
        Improved validation of branches in project configuration.
        Previously the server would accept branches that had no paths
        defined. Now the server-side validation matches the client-side
        validation and such branches produce an error.

    #1003822 (Bug #78437)
        Attempting to access the '/view' or '/download' URIs for a folder
        (not a file) now produces a 404 response.

    #997596, 1015136 (Bug #77206)
        Minor aesthetic fixes. Adjusted the position of popover and tooltip
        arrows when the browser's view is magnified. Improved the contrast
        of keyboard shortcut hints.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2014.4

    #982485 (Bug #76736)
        Swarm is now distributed under a BSD-style two-clause license.

    #965185 (Bug #76239)
        Performance has been significantly improved for sites with a
        large number of protections entries. This should be particularly
        noticeable when browsing files.

    #905488, #962547 (Bug #73830)
        Added options to disable sending emails to all project members for
        commits and new review requests. The project edit page now has two
        checkboxes that can control project notification emails.

Minor new functionality in 2014.4

    #986364 (Bug #76961)
        Added 'apiVersions' to the output of the 'version' endpoint. This
        field includes a list of all of the api versions supported by the
        instance of Swarm (e.g. 1, 1.1).

    #970399 (Bug #70284)
        It is now possible to limit the range of changes shown on the
        history tab to a specific range using change numbers, dates,
        labels, etc.

    #968015 (Bug #66742)
        Project creation can be limited to only users under specific
        group(s) by setting 'add_project_groups' under the 'security'
        config. This feature is disabled by default.

    #967909 (Bug #76291)
        Swarm can now be configured to leave reviews in an approved state
        even if they are updated with modified files. By default, reviews
        will still revert to 'needs review' when they are updated with
        modified files. To have reviews stay approved even when modified
        files are added set 'unapprove_modified' to false under the
        'reviews' configuration.

    #965024 (Bug #74656)
        It is now possible to specify required reviewers when creating
        reviews via the API.

Bugs fixed in 2014.4 Patch 1 (since 2014.4/988814)

    #1000792 (Bug #77218)
        Fixed an issue where the workers could stop running if upgrading
        from 2014.2 via RPM packages.

    #991899, #992629 (Bug #77048)
        Fixed an issue where the RPM packages could erroneously disable
        the Perforce PHP extension on upgrade.

    #990382 (Bug #76971)
        Fixed an issue where the RPM packages did not require the DOM
        or mbstring extensions needed for RSS feeds and multi-byte strings.

Bugs fixed in 2014.4

    #986536 (Bug #76569)
        Fixed a problem where buttons did not always disable properly when
        submitted. This only affected some browsers and appeared to be
        caused by a race condition between the click and blur events.

    #985713 (Bug #76963)
        Fixed an issue with our icon sprites. Previously when scaling up
        your browser view, some icons would erroneously show pixels from
        adjacent icons. Now the sprites have generous spacing to avoid this
        issue.

    #972442 (Bug #76382)
        Fixed an issue where the submit button on the "Add a Commit" and
        "Already Committed" dialogs could erroneously stay disabled
        after a change had been selected.

    #968046, #969029 (Bug #74760)
        When emulating IP protections, enabled by default, Swarm will
        now correctly treat protection entries as as case-insensitive
        when dealing with a case-insensitive Perforce server.

    #968037 (Bug #75488)
        Fixed an issue where @mentioned and @*mentioned users were not
        added as reviewers when creating a review using the API.

    #967896, #967998 (Bug #73701)
        Fixed an issue where committing to a streams depot via the Swarm
        web interface could erroneously report 'No files to submit'.

    #950565 (Bug #72392)
        Fixed an issue where LibreOffice could become unresponsive.
        Generating doc previews should now be significantly more reliable.

    #939315 (Bug #74463)
        When a 'strict' or 'enforce' Swarm trigger fails due to bad
        credentials, include the active P4PORT setting in the error message
        to help diagnose problems more easily.

    #933049, #933477 (Bug #74860)
        Updating an approved review with unchanged ktext files will no
        longer cause it to erroneously revert to the needs review state.
        Note, this fix only works when operating against a 2012.2 or
        newer Perforce server.

    #898943 (Bug #72908)
        Fixed an issue where the horizontal scrollbar could disappear if
        a collapsed file toggled between side-by-side and inline diff.

    #897986 (Bug #66554)
        Fixed an issue where logging in to comment on the left hand side
        of a side-by-side diff would collapse the comment row.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2014.3 Patch 2 (since 2014.3/958056)

    #967594 (Bug #75006)
        Swarm is now free of charge for all Perforce users.
        A Swarm license file is no longer required for operation.

Major new functionality in 2014.3

    #890602 (Bug #66725)
        Added the option to show 10 more lines of context on diffs by
        clicking on the blank row that separates the diffs.

    #889932 (Bug #73703)
        When a review is updated with modified files, existing votes will
        now be marked as 'stale'. Stale votes will be shown with a faded
        icon and will not count towards up-votes or down-votes.

    #889492 (Bug #63260)
        It is now possible to mark files in reviews as 'read'. To mark a
        file as read, click the 'eye' button on the far right of the
        file header. The read flag is remembered independently for each
        user along with the version and file digest information. If the
        contents of the file change, the 'read' flag automatically clears.
        This feature can be helpful when reviewing lots of files.

    #884641, #887942, #889744, #890743 (Bug #63263)
        Swarm now supports treating comments as light-weight tasks. Tasks
        can be marked as 'addressed' and may optionally be 'verified'.

    #877136 (Bug #73157)
        If a change has been associated to a review, Swarm will always
        update the review when files are shelved or the change is
        committed.

        Previously, if the #review-123 or [review-123] style keyword
        wasn't present, the review would not have been updated.

    #854977, #863042, #873042, #875837, #876579, #889563 (Bug #70664)
        Swarm now has an API that exposes and documents various tasks
        that were previously difficult to accomplish.

        The API supports listing reviews, retrieving information about an
        individual review, creating a review from an existing pending or
        submitted change, adding a change to a review (making it the new
        Head revision of that review), listing projects, and creating new
        entries in the Activity list.

        Authentication is handled using standard HTTP Basic Auth, with
        either a password or a ticket. Note that passwords will not work
        in higher-security configurations, so a ticket may be required.

Minor new functionality in 2014.3 Patch 1 (since 2014.3/896879)

    #957494 (Bug #74292)
        Added support for optional POST params when configuring automated
        tests on a project. Data can be specified in either get=param
        style or as {"json" : "values"}

Minor new functionality in 2014.3

    #886023 (Bug #73067)
        Comment attachments will now be cached by the browser for 12 hours.
        This will decrease jumpiness when rendering attached images.

    #882741 (Bug #73058)
        The Swarm cron script now supports starting workers on SSL-enabled
        Swarm hosts that utilize a self-signed certificate.

    #879274 (Bugs #62048, #69646, #71743, #72202)
        The Reviews page now updates the URL to reflect search terms. This
        allows users to bookmark or share searches and ensures the search
        results are shown correctly when navigating browsers history.

    #878436 (Bug #73357)
        Swarm will now linkify occurrences of "changelist <#>" in comments
        and changelist descriptions.

    #878206, #878814, #879346, #879579 (Bug #72736)
        The Swarm OVA is now built using Swarm packages. This allows the
        user to more easily upgrade Swarm.

    #875126 (Bug #66253)
        The jobs page now updates the URL to reflect search terms. This
        allows users to bookmark or share searches and ensures the search
        results are shown correctly when navigating browsers history.

    #871859 (Bug #66355)
        Dropdown menus in Swarm can now be operated via the keyboard.

    #870337, #870357 (Bugs #70905, #71325, #72767)
        Several enhancements have been made to the Swarm JIRA module. JIRA
        Swarm links now include a snippet of the change/review description.
        Additionally, editing a submitted change description or
        adding/removing jobs on a change or review will update JIRA Swarm
        links.  Note, old links are not automatically updated to include
        descriptions.

    #862937, #870621 (Bug #69205)
        Swarm now has a default tab-size of 4 in Chrome, Firefox and
        Safari.  Internet Explorer does not support tab-size and will
        still display a tab width of 8.

    #860398 (Bug #66357)
        Added a 'system' avatar for activity not associated with a
        particular user (for example when tests pass or fail).

    #860346 (Bug #73032)
        Swarm now allows changes by specific users to be ignored from the
        perspective of starting and updating reviews. This is enabled by
        specifying 'ignored_users' under the 'reviews' config.

    #860321 (Bug #73057)
        Mainlines are now listed first under the Review queue's branch
        filter.

    #855740 (Bug #67654)
        Added support for rendering SVG images in file preview, file diffs
        and comment attachments.

    #853423 (Bug #72412)
        The #review keyword is now more forgiving of nearby punctuation.

    #848771 (Bug #72359)
        Swarm now automatically reverts review state back to 'Needs Review'
        when approved reviews are updated with modified files.

    #846902 (Bug #72448)
        Added a swarm of bees that fly around your cursor on the error
        page.  As you move your mouse more bees surround your cursor. Over
        time, if you hold your mouse still, the bees go away.

    #842916, #851529 (Bug #72559)
        We now do a case insensitive lookup for @mentioned jobs.

    #842660 (Bug #73720)
        Basic Auth is now a supported means of authentication. This means
        that actions which previously required 2 steps (performing a login,
        writing the resulting cookie to a cookie jar, and then performing
        the actual action) can now be streamlined into a single request.

        The username must match a valid perforce user with permissions to
        perform the action, and the password can be a valid ticket or the
        user's password.

        Note: Some p4d security levels only allow the use of tickets in
        this context.

    #840855 (Bug #72696)
        Upgraded jQuery to 1.11.1 and added the jQuery sourcemap.

    #839881 (Bug #72704)
        Adjusted the sorting of files and directories when browsing to put
        hidden (e.g. '.foo') files and directories last.

    #836802 (Bug #72385)
        For inline comments, the row will now collapse when the last open
        comment is archived.

Bugs fixed in 2014.3 Patch 2 (since 2014.3/958056)

    #967444 (Bug #73582)
        Fixed an issue where the Debian packages could fail to properly
        install the Perforce PHP extension. The Debian packages now work
        correctly on Ubuntu 13.10, 14.04, 14.10.

Bugs fixed in 2014.3

    #893456 (Bug #73882)
        Fixed an issue where URL-encoded characters could erroneously show
        up in filenames under the activity feed or comments tab.

    #892728 (Bug #73833)
        Logging in with the incorrect cAsE user id on a case insensitive
        p4d will no longer prevent transitioning and approving reviews.

    #892681 (Bug #73832)
        Fixed an issue where using characters like % and # in your filename
        would cause errors when trying to show full context.

    #892564 (Bug #73824)
        Fixed an issue where placeholder text in IE erroneously acted as
        default values for new inline comments under sideways diff mode.

    #892532 (Bug #73826)
        Fixed an issue where the comments could overlay code lines if the
        comment was wide enough to wrap and diff scrollbars were showing.

    #891999 (Bug #73759)
        Swarm will display a warning if thread-safe PHP is detected. This
        is because P4PHP is does not support threaded operation.

    #891941 (Bug #71531)
        Ensure all emails are set to use UTF-8 encoding so extended
        characters display properly.

    #890428 (Bug #71549)
        Attempting to commit a review with out of date files no longer logs
        an exception. An error is still shown to the user in the Swarm UI.

    #890422 (Bug #72918)
        If Swarm encounters a task file it cannot delete; it will no
        longer process it and will abort the worker. This will prevent
        endlessly reprocessing the task.

    #890342, #892319 (Bug #73718)
        The windows trigger script now wraps the path to curl in quotes
        allowing curl.exe to be under a path with spaces.

    #888871 (Bug #73599)
        Fixed an issue where using the context menu to paste content
        into the comment form would fail to enable the post button.

    #887895 (Bug #71805)
        Adding a new comment will no longer show files that were attached
        to a previously posted comment.

    #886698 (Bug #73581)
        Performance improvements for rendering larger files in IE.
        Performance was increased by about 30% for the rendering of the
        side-by-side Diff mode. For files with more than 1000 lines this
        can still be very slow, we plan to continue making improvements.

    #880741 (Bug #65586)
        Introduced tab history tracking for IE9. Previously IE9 would load
        the correct tabs for urls with tab ids but would not insert tab
        ids when navigating tabs in Swarm.

    #879459 (Bug #67480)
        ARIA labels have been added to the filter buttons on the Reviews
        Queue in order to expose their meaning to screen readers.

    #877109 (Bug #73296)
        Swarm will no longer enter an endless loop when the 'swarm' group
        references recursive sub-groups.

    #873881 (Bug #73084)
        Fixed an issue where users would sometimes be required to login to
        comment despite having recently logged in.

    #863379 (Bug #66712)
        Swarm will no longer fail to update reviews when the Swarm admin
        user has changed.

    #861147 (Bug #73037)
        The json output for projects no longer leaks automated test and
        deploy settings. These values can include sensitive data such as
        auth tokens.

    #860313, #861755 (Bug #73056)
        Improved handling of empty descriptions in commit and review email
        notifications. We no longer append a trailing '-' to the subject
        and we no longer output an empty description block in the body.

    #855747 (Bug #72716)
        Fixed a bug where selecting the already active project/branch
        filter would erroneously clear the filter.

    #860349 (Bug #61897)
        We now prevent service and operator type users from logging in.

    #851970 (Bug #72825)
        Fixed an issue where Swarm was generating 'Unknown command' errors
        on Perforce Server's using structured logs. Instead of running a
        null command, we now run 'help' to avoid the error. Further, we
        only test the connection if it appears necessary which should
        provide a minor performance boost.

    #849546 (Bug #72860)
        Following an inline comment link to a file open for 'add' no longer
        produces a JavaScript error.

    #848957 (Bug #72845)
        The trigger script will now fallback to curl if wget returns an
        exit code of 126 or higher. Previously we only fellback for 127.

    #842648 (Bug #72680)
        We now correctly detect files of type 'import' as being adds.

    #842413 (Bug #72707)
        Reviews now only reference projects/branches impacted by the
        current version.

    #841620 (Bug #70219)
        Invalid/non-existent jobs added to a change no longer result in a
        HTTP-500 error.

    #841606 (Bug #71843)
        Uploading a directory now results in an error message, not an
        unreadable white bar.

    #836796 (Bug #72523)
        IE11 is no longer erroneously detected as being Firefox by Swarm's
        generic error handling code.

    #836814 (Bug #72435)
        Modal dialogs now display on top of tooltips, previously they could
        erroneously overlap the dialog.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2014.2

    #825537, #825687 (Bug #72144)
        Reviews can now optionally have required reviewers. A review cannot
        be approved until all required reviewers have up-voted the review.

        To aid in managing reviewers and defining who is required, a new
        'Edit Reviewers' dialog has been added. The review author, perforce
        admins and perforce super users are always able to edit reviewers.

        Additionally, the following individuals may edit reviewers:
        - If the review is moderated, the moderators
        - If the review is part of a project, but not moderated, all
          project members
        - If the review is not part of a project, any authenticated user

        Lastly, individuals may now leave a review, make their vote
        required or make their vote optional by clicking their own avatar
        under the reviewers listing. This is in addition to the existing
        options to join, vote-up and vote-down.

    #823254, #825263 (Bugs #67052, #67054)
        Branches can now optionally have moderators. If moderators are
        defined, only those users are allowed to 'approve' or 'reject'
        reviews under the branch.

        When a review is associated with a moderated branch:
        - Only moderators can approve or reject the review; they can also
          perform all other transitions.
        - Authors can move between needs-review/needs-revision/archived and
          can attach commits; they cannot approve or reject review (even if
          they are a moderator)
        - Members can move between needs-review/needs-revision and can
          attach commits; they cannot approve/reject or archive.
        - Users that are not project members, moderators or the author
          cannot perform any transitions.

        Note, for the author and project members, if the review is not
        presently in one of their permitted states (e.g.: it is rejected)
        they cannot transition it.

    #805100, #805438 (Bug #66173)
        By default, reviews that are committed via the Swarm web UI will
        now be credited to the review author. Activity and email
        notifications will include both the committer and review author's
        details. This is a configuration option which defaults to true.

    #804532, #820256 (Bug #67053)
        A project can now optionally specify one or more owners. When a
        project has owners, only the owners (as well as admin or super
        level users) can edit the project.

    #796111, #796324, #804292, #803304 (Bug #69605)
        Comment boxes now support file attachments via drag-and-drop
        upload. To enable this feature create a "//.swarm" depot or set the
        depot storage base path to a location Swarm can write to.

Minor new functionality in 2014.2

    #834780 (Bug #72549)
        Updated the P4PHP binaries to be built with a patched P4API that
        does not reference the Heartbleed-vulnerable OpenSSL version.

    #825849 (Bug #66469)
        The Swarm favicon is now larger.

    #824751 (Bug #72388)
        Fixed a bug where trigger tokens were not protected from non-super
        users that requested JSON formatted '/about' output.

    #820025 (Bug #71330)
        Multiple Swarm instances can now safely operate on the same machine
        where the address only varies by port, even if SERVER_PORT is
        misreporting.

    #811552, #814057, #814086 (Bug #67051)
        Project creation can be limited to admin users by setting
        'add_project_admin_only' under the 'security' config. This feature
        is disabled by default.

    #810137, #812142 (Bug #66408)
        Ensured the horizontal scroll bar is always visible when viewing a
        change or review diff.

    #805410, #805415, #805458 (Bug #72039)
        Upgraded Zend Framework from 2.1.4 to 2.2.6 for a number of fixes
        and enhancements.

    #805070 (Bug #72042)
        Enhanced the queue status to report future-tasks separately.

    #801759 (Bug #71598)
        Added support for GitHub style line links (e.g.: '#L123') and
        highlighting of linked line; additionally, if you specify a range
        of lines (e.g.: '#10-20'), Swarm will highlight all of the lines in
        the range.

    #800253 (Bug #71712)
        Improved the configuration error message to alert the user if the
        data directory is unwriteable, or no php.ini is found.

    #797479, #799428, #800567, #801819 (Bugs #71679, #71718)
        Added a new URL shortening feature. This adds a small 'bookmark'
        button to the file browser page. Clicking the button generates a
        short URL and displays it in a small popover dialog that the user
        can easily copy from. A short link like this will redirect the user
        to a (presumably) much longer address. Also added support for a
        dedicated short-link hostname; this is a domain to use for short
        links to make them even shorter. Short links are handy for email,
        chat, etc.

    #796834, #803372 (Bugs #71521, #71738)
        Enhanced the trigger script to operate with in-place edits, or
        externalized configuration (implicit and explicit via -c config).
        This is helpful so that configuration can be more easily separated
        from the script itself.

    #791347 (Bug #71159)
        Expose a configuration setting to allow suppressing the Reply-To:
        email header field. This is helpful when you don't want to expose
        Perforce user email addresses in email notifications.

    #790928 (Bug #71396)
        When copying lines of text from a review or changes page, line
        numbers in diff no longer end up in your clipboard. All supported
        browsers still display the line numbers. IE still copies the line
        numbers if you multi-select lines.

    #790472 (Bug #71366)
        Remove the border styles from the diff table to provide a cleaner
        look, and also reduce visual glitches to table borders.

    #789318 (Bug #71717)
        Swarm now compresses JSON sent to the browser for better
        performance.

    #789217, #789221 (Bug #66706)
        Upgraded jQuery from 1.9.1 to 1.11.1 for performance improvements.

    #787961 (Bug #70991)
        Workers will effectively restart if Swarm detects the config.php
        file has been changed. This helps prevent the long running workers
        from using stale config.php settings.

    #782170, 794566 (Bugs #71160, #71327)
        Improved the performance of the home page, particularly when there
        are large numbers of projects or activity events.

    #781997 (Bug #70687)
        Display a tip at the bottom of review and change pages indicating
        the user can use the N and P keys to move between the changes.

    #781805 (Bug #71393)
        Upgraded JSRender from 1.0pre to 1.0.0beta.

Bugs fixed in 2014.2 Patch 2 (since 2014.2/841040)

    #853220 (Bug #72903)
        Administrators can now disable system info along with the related log
        and php info pages by setting 'disable_system_info' to true under the
        'security' config. By default, system info is still accessible to
        authenticated admin or super level users.

    #853054, #853496, #853533 (Bug #72881)
        The CSRF token is now passed as a POST param not a GET param. This
        should reduce the risk of exposure in logs, referrers, etc.

    #846204, #853041 (Bug #72805)
        Fixed a local XSS vulnerability in error messages when posting
        forms in Swarm.

Bugs fixed in 2014.2 Patch 1 (since 2014.2/835154)

    #840956 (Bug #72712)
        Made the details about changes to reviewers (e.g. 'Added user as a
        required reviewer') easier to distinguish from the description of
        the review in email notifications.

    #840731 (Bug #72698)
        Adjusted edit reviewers activity to clearly report when users are
        added. Previously we just stated 'Made user a required reviewer';
        it was unclear if they were being added or edited.

    #839300 (Bug #72658)
        When upgrading Swarm, browsers would sometimes hold onto outdated
        CSS and JavaScript potentially resulting in errors. Links to the
        minified CSS/JS now include the Swarm patch number to avoid this.

    #838036, #838043, #838150 (Bug #61429)
        Added CSRF protection to all mutative actions. For authenticated
        users, requests that are not a GET (e.g. POST, DELETE, PATCH, etc.)
        must now include a valid _csrf token. Actions which are
        'login_exempt' or 'csrf_exempt' do not require the token to be
        passed.

    #835869 (Bug #72611)
        Fixed an issue where Swarm was not setting the 'Remember me' cookie
        with the secure flag when appropriate.

    #835868 (Bugs #72548, #72568)
        Swarm can now be used in deployments where a proxy/balancer handles
        encryption and forwards plain HTTP traffic on to the Swarm server.
        When 'https_strict' is enabled, we now always send the HSTS header
        and we always flag cookies as secure only. Additionally, we now
        allow the administrator to disable the HTTPS redirect for HTTP
        clients by setting 'https_strict_redirect' to false under the
        'security' config.

    #835821 (Bug #72565)
        We now only start a session when needed (e.g. anonymous users don't
        get a session until they try to login). We also attempt to clear
        the session cookie on logout or session expiration.

    #835815, #835866 (Bug #72678)
        The diff endpoint will now produce a 404 error when attempting to
        diff a non-existent file. Previously a 500 error was produced.

    #835789 (Bug #72566)
        Swarm now supports specifying a session lifetime. If the session is
        not accessed for the specified duration, the user will be logged
        out.  By default the duration is 30 days but can be adjusted by
        setting the 'gc_maxlifetime' under the 'session' config. This
        feature will apply when using the default file based session
        storage. Other storage backends are presently unverified.

    #835577 (Bug #72564)
        Swarm no longer sends two Set-Cookie headers for the SWARM session
        ID on login. There is no functional change, this is just an
        aesthetic improvement to the response.

    #835554 (Bug #72571)
        Fixed an issue where toggling the 'Remember me' checkbox on login
        did not correctly adjust the session lifetime.

Bugs fixed in 2014.2

    #833850 (Bug #72510)
        Fixed an issue on Safari 5.1 where comment user avatars were not
        being sized correctly.

    #833609 (Bug #72505)
        Fixed an issue to ensure commits via Swarm keep the restricted or
        public type of the authoritative shelf.

    #827517 (Bug #72362)
        Fixed an issue where it was not possible to @mention a user that
        contained a backslash (such as an AD domain user).

    #826264 (Bug #72378)
        Fixed an issue with the job dialog automatically refreshing when
        attempting to select a row.

    #821123 (Bug #72390)
        Fixed a race-condition where automated tests for a review could
        fail if the pending review was committed before the tests ran.

    #821027 (Bug #72248)
        Fixed an issue where you could not change the review status of a
        review that was somehow stuck. Now, such a review can be
        transitioned to Needs Review, Needs Revision or Archive to clear
        the status.

    #820630 (Bug #72225)
        Fixed an issue in Firefox where the archive comment tooltips would
        get orphaned.

    #820120 (Bug #72391)
        Fixed an issue where the reviews queue would reload when the search
        input loses focus, even if the search value had not changed.

    #820005 (Bug #71764)
        Fixed an issue where Safari 5.1.x would throw a JavaScript error
        when navigating files using the back or forward buttons.

    #819959 (Bug #71459)
        Fixed a bug where protection table entries with spaces caused
        errors.

    #819822 (Bug #72224)
        Fixed an issue where no error message was displayed for
        browser-to-Swarm network errors.

    #814092, #824517 (Bug #64793)
        Fixed an issue where timezones were incorrect when Swarm was
        connected to a Windows p4d server.

    #813797 (Bug #72064)
        Fixed an issue where modal cancel buttons were being marked as
        ARIA-hidden.

    #809521 (Bug #71986)
        Fixed an issue with the 3D model viewer where it was looking at
        0,0,0 instead of the center of the model.

    #804290 (Bug #71851)
        Fixed a bug where the reviews page would issue excessive XHR
        requests, impairing browsing performance.

    #800358, #801075 (Bug #72003)
        Adjusted avatar styles to only show the default avatars when the
        user's Gravatar has finished loading. This prevents a momentary
        flash of the default avatar that could sometimes occur if Gravatar
        was slow.

    #799622 (Bug #71367)
        Swarm now normalizes the hostname specified in the config file to
        properly handle schemes and non-standards ports.

    #799558 (Bug #71680)
        Swarm no longer prevents the browser from handling control/command
        clicks in the Swarm File Browser.

    #794840 (Bugs #70317, #70295)
        Fixed several small issues with the file browser. Previously the
        handling of what controls were shown on different tabs was spread
        out and inconsistent. We also previously missed detecting all the
        cases where the tab had changed.

    #792725 (Bug #65644)
        Fixed an issue on IE9 where the archived comments area would toggle
        twice the first time it was clicked, so you would need to click
        again.

    #792034 (Bug #71138)
        Fixed an issue where certain special characters, like '@', '#', and
        '%' were escaped in email depot paths.

    #790454 (Bug #70231)
        Fixed an issue where linking to an archived comment did not expand
        the collapsed archive area to scroll to the comment.

    #790437 (Bug #71372)
        Enhance the N/P keydown listener to only handle one keydown per
        keypress. This should prevent issues with the focus moving further
        than expected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2014.1

    #774422, #775409 (Bug #70659)
        Swarm now renders 3D model files (.STL, .OBJ or .DAE) in the file
        browser and diff. The viewer will attempt to pull in referenced
        resources, including MTL files, in the model objects, but will only
        be able to display textures if they are web-safe images (e.g.: .PSD
        textures will not render). If using a modern browser, and hardware
        acceleration is available, the viewer should run smoothly. If using
        a modern browser, and there is no hardware acceleration available,
        the viewer will run without WebGL, and may be slow; we don't
        auto-rotate in this case to reduce CPU utilization. If you are not
        using a modern browser, you will just receive a 'viewer not
        supported' message.

    #772465 (Bug #68885)
        Git users may now perform pre-commit reviews using Swarm, via
        Perforce Git Fusion. To start a pre-commit review, simply push to
        /reviews/master/new, where 'master' is the target branch. More
        details on usage are available in the Swarm documentation.

    #767962, #775774, #776148 (Bug #66723)
        Restricted changes are filtered from the UI if the user does not
        have permission to view them.

Minor new functionality in 2014.1

    #775670 (Bug #65494)
        Swarm checks for the existence of the config.php file and if not
        present, displays a suitable error to the user.

    #775412 (Bug #68201)
        RTF files, although text, will now be rendered through the
        LibreOffice module if present.

    #772469 (Bug #70803)
        The strict and enforce trigger types can now be scoped to just
        changes in a review using the -r flag. This allows unreviewed
        changes to proceed, but changes in a review must be approved.

    #771462 (Bug #70758)
        When calling automated tests for a review, Swarm now lists only
        branches impacted by the current change in the {branch} and
        {branchName} keywords.

    #770126 (Bug #70798)
        The amount of time and memory that worker processes use is now
        constrained. Previously, a worker could use an unlimited amount of
        memory and run for ever (no limits). Now, the limits for a worker
        can be set in the config file and default to 1GB and 30min
        respectively. The 30min timeout is reset for each task. No task
        can spend more than 30min of CPU time.

    #765295 (Bug #70583)
        For a project's branches listed on the project page, the mainline
        branches are displayed first, and the remaining are now sorted
        alphabetically.

    #762726, #763003, #770626, #773997 (Bugs #70611, #70612, #70613)
        Further reduced memory consumption in the processing of users and
        groups. For example, with 10,000 users and over 1,000 groups, Swarm
        previously used ~140MB of memory when populating the caches and
        ~120MB when reading from the caches; with these changes, memory
        usage drops to ~35MB and ~12MB respectively.

Bugs fixed in 2014.1

    #777472 (Bug #70940)
        Fixed an issue where improper permissions on the token directory
        would result in an infinite loop.

    #774788 (Bug #70842)
        Fixed an issue in Chrome when viewing a large image retrieved from
        cache would cause the page to continually refresh.

    #773886 (Bug #70813)
        Fixed display issues in IE with the filename bar on a review page.

    #772345 (Bug #70774)
        Improved the scrolling performance in Chrome on Review pages by
        manually instructing the browser which areas to repaint when
        scrolling a file.

    #769901 (Bug #70797)
        Fixed an issue where filenames with special characters were
        improperly displayed in a comment tagline.

    #769859 (Bug #69623)
        Fixed an IE11 performance issue when viewing the Reviews page.

    #766082 (Bug #70599)
        Fixed an issue when browsing project files would cause a HTTP 500
        error if one of the project's branch definitions contained a path
        ending with a slash (as opposed to '/...').

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2013.3

    #749961, #750778, #751112 (Bug #69119)
        Swarm now allows participants to vote up or down on a review. The
        reviews page replaces the participants columns with an up/down
        votes column.

    #730156, #747698, #748957 (Bug #69279)
        Swarm can now emulate IP-based Perforce protections. Swarm will
        check the user's IP address and use it to apply any necessary
        restrictions, such as when browsing files, viewing file content,
        viewing & adding comments on files.

    #724625 (Bug #60905)
        Added ability to comment at the file-level on reviews and changes.
        Files in changes and reviews will now have a footer to display and
        add comments similar to the existing inline comment interface.

Minor new functionality in 2013.3

    #751165 (Bugs #68207, #69624)
        Eliminated redundant commit activity and email notification. This
        would occur when a change linked to a review was committed. Now,
        the commit is reported only once.

    #751085 (Bug #69749)
        Old invalidated cache files are now cleared out periodically.

    #750074 (Bug #70114)
        Swarm will log warnings when Perforce commands take longer than a
        prescribed time. By default, the print, submit, sync, shelve, and
        unshelve commands' threshold is 10 seconds; for all others, it is 3
        seconds.

    #749100 (Bug #70023)
        Swarm will perform XHProf profiling if the 'xhprof' PHP extension
        is present and requests take longer than a prescribed time (by
        default, 3 seconds). Data collected will be placed in the
        data/xhprof directory.

    #748526 (Bug #70110)
        When browsing a project's branches, mainlines now appear first and
        are bolded as they are the most frequently accessed codelines.

    #747404 (Bug #70017)
        The Swarm distribution now includes P4PHP binaries for PHP 5.5.

    #745637 (Bug #69980)
        Commit email notifications now include a link to their associated
        review.

    #734207, #751251 (Bug #69487)
        Swarm can now display deleted files and folders when browsing
        files.

    #732930 (Bug #69636)
        Added support for hashtag (more formally known as "octothorpe"!)
        style review keywords; e.g. #review or #review-1234. Note the
        keyword is only honoured if it is preceeded and followed by either
        whitespace or EOL/SOL. Unlike the square-bracket convention
        [review], the hashtag style review keyword can appear anywhere in
        the description, not just at the beginning or end.

    #728989 (Bug #60909)
        Users can now comment on jobs in Swarm under the new 'Comments' tab
        on the job page. When there is a new comment, Swarm will send an
        email notification to users listed in 'user' fields in the job,
        @mentioned in the job description and users of associated changes.

    #728163 (Bug #69542)
        Avoid session locking to improve performance when making multiple
        simulatenous requests. This should improve the ability to browse in
        other tabs while file previews are being converted/transferred.

    #723845 (Bug #64834)
        Added a system information page (/info), accessible to users with
        admin privileges. The page displays Perforce Server information,
        PHP info, and the Swarm log, which can be downloaded.

    #722080 (Bug #69406)
        Enhanced the 'jobs' route to automatically prepend 'job0...' if the
        given ID is numeric and doesn't exactly match an existing job. For
        example, /jobs/12345 will resolve to /jobs/job012345.

    #721850 (Bug #69380)
        Added a new 'disable_commit' option under the 'reviews' section in
        the configuration. Enabling this option will remove the "Approve
        and Commit" and "Commit" options from the Swarm web interface.
        External commits via traditional Perforce clients will still be
        possible. This setting is false by default.

    #720456 (Bug #69290)
        If a user adds themselves as a review participant, Swarm will no
        longer email the new participant, though all other participants
        will still be notified.

    #719792, #719938 (Bug #69245)
        Added icons next to changes listed on the jobs page to indicate
        their type (review, commit, pending).

    #718564 (Bug #69206)
        Added new 'http_client_options' configuration. This allows
        administrators to specify HTTP communication options (particularly
        useful for HTTPS related options) either globally, or host-
        specific.

    #716765 (Bug #65289)
        Improved HTTPS support via a 'strict_https' option. When enabled,
        viewing an HTTP link will include a meta-refresh to the HTTPS
        version, a strict transport security header will be included for
        all HTTPS requests (pinning the browser to HTTPS for 30 days), all
        qualified URLs will use HTTPS for the scheme, and cookies on HTTPS
        connections will be flagged HTTPS-only

    #716542 (Bug #66938)
        Updated the Jobs page to allow selecting and re-ordering columns
        representing job fields.

        Columns can now be selected via the 'Select Columns' drop-down
        button located beside the search box.  Users can select columns to
        show in the table below by checking them in the drop-down (showing
        all available fields, where the selected ones are always located at
        the top of the list).

        Selected columns can also be re-ordered, either by dragging them
        into desired spot in the drop-down or in the table header.

    #714786, #715519, #715658, #719803, #720491 (Bugs #69093, #69647)
        Swarm has a new design that is cleaner and brighter with fewer
        borders. The projects sidebar has been moved to the left-hand side
        of the home page. This fixes an issue loading activity on mobile
        devices. Events in the activity table are now color-coded (with a
        thin vertical line on the far-right edge) to indicate the type of
        activity.

    #714421 (Bug #69090)
        Enhanced our emojify filter to make use of Gemoji images if they
        are installed under public/vendor/gemoji. Gemoji provides support
        for more emojis and works on more browsers and platforms than the
        unicode codepoints we normally use. For more information about
        Gemoji, see https://github.com/github/gemoji.

    #713201 (Bug #68815)
        Introduced 'use_bcc' configuration item under 'mail' to address
        recipients of changelist notifications via the BCC field instead of
        the TO field. See the Email configuration section under
        Administration of the documentation.

Bugs fixed in 2013.3 patch 1 (since 2013.3/759531)

    #762450 (Bug #70489)
        Fixed an issue with the automated test and deployment integrations
        where the branch ID was passed but documented as the branch name.
        We now provide both the ID and name for branches and projects, and
        the documentation has been corrected.

    #762417 (Bug #70490)
        Addressed a browser performance problem involving collapsed files
        on review and changes pages.

    #761990, #762232 (Bug #70467)
        Improved the efficiency of processing Perforce groups to reduce
        memory consumption. For example, with thousands of users and
        groups, memory consumption is reduced by approximately 80%.

    #761155 (Bug #70461)
        Fixed the queue location when using the SWARM_DATA_PATH override.

Bugs fixed in 2013.3

    #757302 (Bug #69995)
        Fixed a bug where multibyte UTF-8 sequences in user ID's could lead
        to HTTP 500 errors.

    #755964 (Bug #70225)
        Fixed the activity display for a user whose ID contains a period.

    #751230 (Bug #69672)
        Fixed erroneous 'approved' email when committing a review from
        Swarm where the review was already approved.

    #751219 (Bug #69696)
        Fixed an issue where including an invalid change number when adding
        a commit to a review would throw an exception instead of returning
        a nicely formatted error.

    #751195 (Bug #65646)
        Fixed an issue where the 'Commit' button in the Commit Review
        dialog became prematurely enabled.

    #751100 (Bug #69666)
        Fixed an issue where some errors were not being displayed when
        failing to commit a review from Swarm.

    #751043 (Bug #67471)
        Fixed an issue where a long description of a history entry would
        not be collapsed.

    #751013 (Bug #68809)
        Fixed an issue where a change description that contained a line
        with only a period as its content would cause email notifications
        to be truncated at that point.

    #747494 (Bug #69651)
        When showing historic context lines on comments, the old context
        will now only be shown once when it applies to multiple sequential
        comments.

    #747607 (Bug #70022)
        Swarm now properly disconnects from the mail server after sending
        an email. Previously, a timeout error could occur if a worker
        processed multiple email related tasks.

    #746579 (Bug #65666)
        Swarm no longer throws an HTTP 500 error when an invalid depot is
        entered within the change select dialog.

    #745635 (Bug #69981)
        When editing a review description, mentioning a user (via @user)
        will now actually add that user as a review participant.

    #745911 (Bug #69204)
        On the history tab, searching for a user with invalid characters
        will no longer generate an error.

    #743323 (Bug #69928)
        Previews of office type documents no longer silently fail on CentOS
        and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

    #736065 (Bug #69737)
        Work around a Chrome bug where clearing out the password field on a
        long page would freeze the browser. See http://crbug.com/180868 for
        details.

    #736112 (Bug #69743)
        Fixed a race condition that could cause the commit status to become
        erroneously stuck at 'unshelving...'.

    #732093 (Bug #66240)
        Fixed a bug where login would fail against a case-insensistive
        Perforce server if the username did not match case exactly.

    #719604 (Bug #69248)
        Fixed a bug where Unicode or UTF-16 text files were not displaying
        properly in Swarm; Perforce converts them to UTF-8 and Swarm now
        flags them as such.

    #716735 (Bug #69129)
        Fixed a bug where the wrong timestamp would be shown in the
        activity feed for certain timezones (e.g. AEST).

    #712670 (Bug #68949)
        Fixed a minor bug where the user could erroneously select a header
        row in the 'Select Job' dialog.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2013.2

    #680316, #681228, #691940 (Bugs #66717, #65503)
        Code reviews are now versioned. A historic copy of proposed work is
        maintained when the review is updated. This allows users to see
        each incremental change made to a review, as well as diff between
        adjacent versions to the review using the new Review Timeline.

    #679062 (Bug #66799)
        Several notable enhancements to the JIRA module. When a change is
        submitted or a review is created/updated, we find any associated
        JIRA issues, via associated jobs or callouts in the description,
        and ensure the JIRA issues link back to the review or change in
        Swarm. Further, the JIRA project list is now fetched automatically
        so you no longer need to hard-code it in the config.php.

    #676580 (Bugs #60923, #67538)
        Added support for committing streams-based reviews in Swarm. With
        this change, it is now possible use Streams-based projects.

    #668325, #680003 (Bugs #67216, 67653)
        Added support for viewing office type documents, such as Word,
        PowerPoint, Excel, Visio and rich text file formats. LibreOffice
        must be installed on the Swarm web server to take advantage of this
        feature. The Swarm OVA comes with the necessary LibreOffice
        components installed to enable this feature.

    #667587 (Bug #66586)
        Added support for previewing BMP, EPS, PSD, TGA, and TIFF formats.
        The ImageMagick PHP extension must be installed and enabled on the
        Swarm web server to take advantage of this feature. The Swarm OVA
        comes with this extension to enable this feature.

    #667207, #677868, #688353 (Bugs #64759, #65017, #67979)
        Swarm reviews and changes now provide a richer jobs integration.
        Users can add or remove job associations for changes and reviews.
        Swarm now allows job selection in the 'Commit Review' dialog,
        similar to P4V. Also, if jobs are present when updating a reviews
        files the jobs will be added to the review.

Minor new functionality in 2013.2

    #695725 (Bug #60941)
        Users with permissions to edit projects can now also delete them
        via a new 'Delete' button in the 'Edit Project' page (confirmation
        is required via the tooltip).

    #695350 (Bug #68256)
        The default diff mode is now side-by-side; your last used diff mode
        will be remembered so this change primarily affects new users.

    #692127 (Bug #68153)
        Swarm now includes Linux variants of P4PHP that are built with
        glibc 2.3.3 to support older distributions, such as Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux 5.9. See the INSTALL.txt for more information.

    #689920 (Bug #68028)
        Swarm's session name now defaults to 'SWARM' for web servers
        running on port 80 or 443. For Swarm instances running on any other
        port, the session name defaults to SWARM-1234 where 1234 is the
        port number in use. This allow running several Swarm instances on a
        single server differentiating them by port and session name.

    #689744 (Bug #66724)
        Revised icons for added, deleted and edited files. These icons are
        colorful with larger +, - and pencil symbols. They should make it
        easier to distinguish between the various actions.

    #689613 (Bug #67755)
        Swarm can now be configured to use a custom avatar URL pattern
        allowing administrators to provide their own avatar server or
        disable custom avatars altogether. By default, custom avatars
        continue to come from Gravatar.

    #688945 (Bug #68046)
        Added a goto route for full or partial Git Fusion SHA1 commits that
        will redirect to the corresponding changelist. e.g.:
        http://myswarmhost/42697a7a79

    #680508 (Bug #62181)
        Swarm now anchors the file toolbar to the top of the window on
        changes/review pages so it stays in view while you are scrolling
        through a file.

    #675826 (Bug #67413)
        Added support for emoji shorthand (e.g. :smile:); see
        http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com for the full list.

    #672699 (Bug #66610)
        Users can now filter the history tab by user when browsing.

    #672363 (Bug #63199)
        Added a apple-touch-icon for iOS (and apparently Android) devices.
        Just one size (144x144) for simplicity.

    #671993 (Bug #67389)
        Restyled the error pages to incorporate our new mascot Bizzy
        Heisenbug and be more scalable/responsive.

    #669938, #693013 (Bugs #66534, #68206)
        Swarm no longer emails the user who commented or performed a review
        state change. Other interested parties are still emailed.
        Additionally, editing a review's description no longer generates an
        email.

    #666778 (Bug #67154)
        Added a new 'prevent_login' configurable to specify a list of
        Perforce users that are not allowed to log in to Swarm.

    #665482 (Bug #67108)
        We now collapse multiple occurrences of certain characters (e.g.:
        ASCII lines) in the subject lines of change notification emails.

    #664426 (Bug #67065)
        Added hooks for previewing non-web-safe file fomats. A custom
        module is required to add support for other formats. In the
        module's bootstrap method you can grab the format manager and add a
        new handler. See the Imagick or LibreOffice modules for example
        usage.

    #664389 (Bug #65015)
        Added a 'My Reviews' filter to the review queue to show only
        reviews the current user is participating in.

    #661459 (Bug #66679)
        Improve configuration error page displayed if PHP-specific
        misconfigurations are detected (such as an unsupported PHP version,
        or missing PHP extensions). All detected misconfigurations are now
        shown in a list. Also, the path to all php ini files is shown to
        ease administration.

    #660436, #669261 (Bug #66573)
        Email notifications from Swarm now include additional email
        headers, 'X-Swarm-Host' and 'X-Swarm-Version'.

    #657062 (Bugs #66598, #66599)
        We now show the text of comments and the description of file
        updates on the review history tab.

    #656605 (Bug #66931)
        Added the ability to set the DATA_PATH via environment variable,
        SWARM_DATA_PATH. This can facilitate hosting multiple Swarm
        instances using a single Swarm installation.

Bugs fixed in 2013.2

    #704590 (Bug #68710)
        Queueing tasks will no longer log a PHP warning in the Apache error
        log when multiple tasks are added in the same millisecond.

    #703451 (Bug #68531)
        Fixed an issue where Swarm would display a 404 error if attempting
        to access the Apache info or status modules' handler paths. Swarm
        now detects if those modules are enabled, and if so, allows access
        to their paths.

    #696121 (Bug #67233)
        Fixed an issue when using Safari where PDF documents would be cut
        off strangely at the bottom of the window.

    #696076 (Bug #68041)
        Fixed an issue when using Internet Explorer where hitting enter in
        a text field would erroneously trigger nearby buttons.

    #691483, #692576 (Bug #68129)
        Swarm no longer "linkifies" deleted user IDs when showing the author
        of a change, comment, activity, etc.

    #689915 (Bug #68056)
        Fixed a bug where URLs using IP addresses were not being linkified.

    #689661 (Bug #68044)
        Fixed issue where Swarm would fail if the 'json' or 'session' PHP
        extensions were not installed; Swarm now checks for the presence of
        these extensions.

    #688137 (Bug #68043)
        Fixed .htaccess rules to allow viewing of documentation when PHP is
        not installed.

    #686394 (Bug #67908)
        Fixed an issue where older systems (e.g.: RHEL/CentOS) would not
        recognize a form of regular expression named capture groups; Swarm
        now uses a more backwards-compatible form.

    #686358 (Bug #67905)
        Fixed an issue where older systems (e.g.: RHEL/CentOS) would fail
        to fetch activity or reviews due to unexpectedly treating the ID as
        a float instead of an integer.

    #685439 (Bug #66446)
        Fixed an issue where the initial activity import could result in
        out of order activity records.

    #684802 (Bug #67816)
        Fixed an issue where token-based auth (alone) wouldn't work for
        deploy and automated test integration if require_login was enabled.

    #681666 (Bug #67720)
        Fixed an issue where it was possible to get an unexpected connect
        exception when accessing Swarm with a partially expired session.

    #681586 (Bug #67507)
        When logging warnings and errors, we no longer include context.
        Large values and excessive escapement made context useless.

    #680229 (Bug #67669)
        Fixed a race-condition where committing through Swarm could fail if
        the change was renumbered upon submit.

    #680188 (Bug #67652)
        Fixed display issues exposed in Firefox when navigating files.

    #679223 (Bug #67616)
        Fixed validation of group names. The rules we were enforcing in
        Swarm did not match the rules enforced by the server.

    #678458 (Bug #67592)
        Fixed a bug that prevented the minified consolidated web assets
        from being included in the distribution.

    #676317 (Bug #67445)
        Fixed an issue where the Comments 'Archive' and 'Restore' buttons
        weren't labelled for screen readers.

    #673297 (Bug #67431)
        Fixed a bug where Swarm only matched the first keyword and stopped.
        If someone used the [review] keyword at the start and end of their
        description this would have left one behind.

    #671254 (Bug #67342)
        Fixed a bug where commenting above a padding line caused a comment
        indicator to appear on the padding line.

    #671092 (Bug #67126)
        Added roles and ARIA labels to fix an issue where the All Projects/
        My Projects dropdown was undiscoverable by NVDA, and where the Add
        Project Link wasn't being described at all by NVDA.

    #669528 (Bug #67262)
        Fixed a bug where the display of ignored whitespace on context
        lines in Swarm was inconsistent with p4 diff/P4Merge if you used
        the 'Show Full Context' feature.

    #668045 (Bug #67214)
        Improved handling of purged files in diff. We no longer attempt to
        show or diff purged files.

    #668043 (Bug #67162)
        Fixed a bug where searching within Help was not working.

    #667916 (Bug #67195)
        Improved Approve & Commit error handling to ensure the attempted
        change is deleted on failure.

    #667915 (Bug #67106)
        Fixed an issue where the pdf preview area was very small on Firefox
        and Internet Explorer.

    #667770 (Bug #67185)
        Fixed an endless loop that could occur when Swarm attempted to
        obtain a client to use from its client pool if file permissions
        were invalid.

    #667226 (Bug #67166)
        Fixed an issue in Swarm Jobs Search where it would still reload
        your query on search blur even after you had just loaded the query
        using the enter key.

    #666601 (Bugs #65684, #67055)
        Fixed an issue where using the back button on a Job page would take
        you back to search page with the previous search filled into the
        field, but not properly filtered in the results.

    #665678 (Bug #67210)
        Fixed a bug where a changelist description that had a numbered list
        item could be linkified if the previous line ended with "change".

    #657378 (Bug #66826)
        Fixed a bug where avatar selection was not consistent when using
        the Suhosin version of PHP. This is because srand() is disabled for
        security reasons.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2013.1

    #647347 (Bug #66023)
        Replaced the grab/release review feature with multiple reviewers.
        It is no longer possible to grab or release a review. Instead,
        anyone other than the auther who participates in a review (e.g.
        comments on, changes the status of, pushes code to, etc.) becomes a
        'reviewer'. Swarm now displays a row of reviewer avatars beneath
        the description of a review. The avatars are preceeded by the text
        'Reviewers' and are aligned right. Users can click to add
        themselves to a review.

        On the reviews queue, the 'Reviewer' column has been removed and a
        new 'Reviewers' column has been added. The reviewers column shows a
        count of reviewers and, when hovered, lists the names of all
        reviewers in a tooltip. Similarly, the assigned/unassigned filter
        has been replaced with a has-reviewers/no-reviewers filter.

    #647277, #647325 (Bug #65934)
        Swarm now requires a license to run against a licensed Perforce
        server. Without a Swarm license, Swarm's functionality is not
        restricted in any way, however a license violation notification
        appears for every page.

        Swarm does not require a license to run against an unlicensed
        Perforce server.

        If Swarm is licensed for fewer users than the Perforce server, only
        members of the 'swarm' group, or a sub-group, are allowed to login
        to Swarm. If a non-member attempts to login and the swarm group is
        not already at capacity, an attempt will be made to automatically
        add them to the group so long as: security => disable_autojoin
        hasn't been set to true (by default it is false).

        Auto-join is not available on Perforce Server versions prior to
        2012.1. In that case it is akin to auto-join being disabled and
        Swarm will handle the login failure gracefully.

        Contact sales@perforce.com to purchase a license or start a free
        trial.

    #645705, #646629, #647327 (Bugs #63686, 65936)
        Swarm now has additional trigger types for review enforcement and
        strict content checking. The '-t enforce' type enforces that
        submits are associated to an approved review. The '-t strict' type
        goes further and ensures that the content being submitted matches
        the content of its approved review. Using '-g <group>' with either
        allows an exempt user group that isn't subject to the check. See
        the documentation on triggers for further information.

    #645011, #645217 (Bugs #60966, #63100)
        Swarm can optionally act as a review daemon, emailing notifications
        about changes to paths that users have expressed interest in via
        reviews entries in their user form; see the documentation on email
        notifications.

Minor new functionality in 2013.1

    #652213 (Bug #66450)
        Swarm pages now include meta information that inform Internet
        Explorer to always use the latest document standards when
        rendering. This prevents users from accidentally running Swarm in
        Compatibility Mode, which is not supported.

    #650691 (Bug #65055)
        Swarm now supports additional browser versions: Apple Safari 5.1+
        and Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.

    #648677 (Bug #66005)
        Added logic to automatically upgrade review records anytime they
        are saved. This is necessary to accommodate changes made to review
        records since 2013.1.BETA/629891.

    #648653
        Added .ico files to the list of 'viewable' (browser-safe) image
        file types.

    #648129, #648274 (Bug #66473)
        The Swarm virtual appliance (OVA) is now based on Ubuntu 12.04.2
        LTS. Connections to SSL-enabled Perforce Servers is now possible.
        The supplied config.php file contains more default entries to make
        customization easier (logging level, notifications to honor P4
        reviews). PHP upgraded to 5.4.15 and is now available in the path.

    #648004 (Bug #66467)
        Swarm now supports a facility for automated deployment for code
        reviews. When configured, a 'Try it out' button will appear on code
        reviews so that reviewers can run the code with minimal effort.
        This facility works very much like the automated tests integration.
        You can optionally specify a 'deploy' url and can pass it
        paramaters such as {change}, {status}, {review}, {project},
        {branch}, {success} and {fail}.

        Everytime a code review is started or its files updated, the deploy
        url will be called. If the build works, your deploy script simply
        requests the {success} address and includes a 'url' get or post
        parameter. If the build fails, your deploy script can optionally
        request the {fail} address. Including a failure url parameter is
        optional but supported.

    #647030 (Bug #66255)
        Changed the title for the personal activity stream from 'Activity'
        to 'Followed Activity'.

    #646877
        Removed the 'Re:' prefix from comment email subjects. They were
        interferring with threading in Gmail.

    #646335 (Bug #66376)
        For Perforce activity initiated from Swarm, the Perforce Server log
        now correctly shows the client as Swarm instead of P4PHP.

    #645421 (Bug #66365)
        Users can now associate additional submitted changes to an existing
        review.

    #645245 (Bug #65597)
        Update the included P4PHP binaries from 2013.1/617119 to the latest
        patched version (2013.1/644389), which includes a crash fix.

    #642465
        Added two links to the committed change on the review page. One
        link is in the byline: '... committed 2 days ago in 54321' (the
        change number is a link). The second link is left of the
        add/edit/delete file count. Previously Swarm showed the change
        number in this location, but it was not a link.

    #640209 (Bug #65894)
        From the Reviews page, Users can click the review state icon to go
        to the review detail page.

    #640072 (Bug #65935)
        Swarm can now properly operate behind a forwarding Perforce
        replica.

    #639765
        The Swarm trigger now tries to use 'wget' first, then 'curl', as
        'wget' is more common. Also modified added the -o flag for
        displaying its trigger table entries.

    #639202, #639414, #639415, #639426, #647014, #647348 (Bug #65937)
        JavaScript performance improvments were made to fix issues around
        logging in and commenting when having many files expanded.

        On a change with 20,000 lines of code, Chrome was taking 140
        seconds to log in; now it takes under a second to log in or
        comment. The expand all on that change was taking around 20 seconds
        in Chrome, but now takes about 3 seconds.

    #637198
        Renamed comment 'close/reopen' to 'archive/restore'.

    #636834 (Bug #64168)
        A notice is displayed if there is no activity to display.

    #636826 (Bug #66031)
        Swarm now allows ticket based login for end-users.

    #636565
        Users @mentioned in change descriptions or comments were not
        previously notified.

    #634561
        Don't send email notification for passing tests unless they were
        previously failing.

    #634313 (Bug #65893)
        Searching on the review page is now case-insensitive.

    #633930
        Swarm now shows the 'committed' icon for reviews that are both
        approved and committed. This is just one more visual clue that the
        review you are looking at is committed.

    #630853 (Bug #65040)
        Swarm now has a new logo; ooh, ahh.

    #620870 (Bug #65042)
        Improve the layout for editing a Swarm project.

Bugs fixed since 2013.1/667767

    #674403 (Bug #67464)
        Fixed a bug where invalid email addresses could prevent valid
        email addresses from receiving messages.

    #673093 (Bug #67415)
        If the change spec was missing the 'Type' field, viewing changes
        was not possible. Swarm is now tolerant of Type not being present.

    #673030 (Bug #67381)
        Fixed a race condition when grabbing tasks out of the queue; in
        some cases, two workers could grab the same task. This manifested
        as unlink warnings in the Swarm log file.

    #672407, #674413 (Bug #67397)
        If custom triggers send output to stdout or stderr, it could cause
        Swarm to malfunction when processing Perforce forms. Swarm is now
        more tolerant of noisy triggers.

    #672230 (Bug #67274)
        If the Perforce Server was restarted during the lifetime of a Swarm
        worker (e.g. a p4d restart), the worker's connection would become
        unusable causing it to throw away tasks. The workers now attempt to
        auto-reconnect to Peforce and they will only process tasks if they
        have a valid connection.

    #671840 (Bug #67299)
        Updated the license validator to handle any command exception; this
        fixes an error that could occur at login on 2010.2 Servers.

    #671322 (Bug #67354)
        Fixed a bug where Swarm's defense against ClickJacking attacks was
        not properly enabled.

    #671321 (Bug #67350)
        Fixed an XSS vulnerability in branch name rendering.

    #670131 (Bug #67309)
        Fixed a bug where users were not being emailed notifications for
        submitted changes against projects they followed (but were not
        members of).

Bugs fixed since 2013.1/652715

    #667718 (Bug #67180)
        Noisy change triggers could prevent Swarm from capturing the number
        of newly created changelists. Swarm now skips over trigger output.

    #667713, #667741 (Bug #67179)
        Certain empty fields in jobs (such as 'user') could cause a 500
        internal server error. Swarm now checks for empty values before
        performing additional processing on special job fields.

    #665389 (Bug #67021)
        Swarm did not show or diff the contents of Unicode or UTF16 files.
        These file types are now treated as text and safe to show or diff.

    #664119 (Bug #67045)
        Swarm's enforce trigger (designed to prevent un-approved submits)
        would occassionally reject an approved submit because of a subtle
        inconsistency in how Swarm was writing review records.

    #662273 (Bug #66963)
        Login and other operations that checked a user's group membership
        could fail with a 500 internal server error if the Perforce Server
        contained any groups with a null id (ultimately due to Perforce
        Server Bug #37630).

    #661073 (Bug #66703)
        The reviews page could issue an excessive number of XHR requests
        against the Swarm server when loading more reviews. Fixed the logic
        that throttles these requests.

    #660074 (Bug #66886)
        Fixed an issue where Swarm could produce a 500 internal server
        error when connecting to a SSL enabled Perforce Server for the
        first time.

Bugs fixed in 2013.1

    #652570 (Bugs #64063, #65566, #65711)
        Dates and times of committed changes and created/updated jobs shown
        on various Swarm pages (Change, Changes, Job, Jobs, Review) were
        incorrect if the user's client machine was in a different timezone
        than Swarm and/or the Perforce server.

    #652515 (Bug #65637)
        IE10 failed to load a single file change if your page first loaded
        with a tab other than Files, such as Comments or History.

    #651899 (Bug #66551)
        The undocumented activity delete action would not function when
        using the -m <max> argument.

    #651855 (Bug #66540)
        If require_login was enabled, console actions would not function.

    #651312 (Bug #66593)
        Web-safe images were not being properly displayed if their filename
        extension was in upper case.

    #647388 (Bug #65304)
        Branches with multiple paths did not map correctly into the
        project's file's branch folder.

    #647380 (Bugs #65525, #65555)
        Filtering the activity or the review queue too quickly would result
        in the toggled filter buttons being out of sync with the actual
        filtered content.

    #647349 (Bug #65831)
        Searching for jobs using an invalid field would cause an HTTP-500
        error.

    #646245 (Bug #65581)
        Logging in would always redirect you to the homepage instead of
        refreshing the current page if the config.php setting
        require_login=true was set.

    #645363 (Bug #65053)
        The changes pages would show up blank when navigating to them using
        your back/forward buttons in your browser.

    #645356
        Made the 'already committed' change selector dialog work even if
        the current change has no base path defined. Previously, if there
        was no base path Swarm would report a 500 error.

    #645338
        Fixed an issue where the review state menu was inoperable if a
        commit was underway. This was happening because Swarm polls for
        commit-status every second and rebuilds the menu. Now, Swarm only
        rebuilds the menu if there is new data.

    #645255 (Bug #65051)
        Avatars' height could be slow to render; Swarm now makes avatars
        take up their proper space before they are loaded.

    #642636 (Bug #65052)
        Browsing history against a remote depot incorrectly would report
        'no matching changes'; Swarm now correctly reports that change
        details are not available.

    #640153 (Bug #64605)
        Email notifications would show occasional signs of corruption.

    #638212 (Bug #66076)
        Invalid UTF-8 characters in a Perforce user name could prevent the
        add/edit project functionality from working correctly; Swarm now
        filters out invalid UTF-8 characters.

    #637913 (Bug #66053)
        Swarm would not warn if the P4PHP extension was missing or not
        loaded; it now displays a message with a link to the documentation
        on how to configure it.

    #637871 (Bug #66073)
        Authentication triggers that outputted additional text could
        prevent Swarm from processing the login correctly; Swarm is now
        more tolerant of "noisy" authentication triggers.

    #637643 (Bugs #65236, #65474, #65491)
        Empty paths, embedded wildcards or non-existent depots in a
        project's branch definition would cause an error at the project's
        files page; these scenarios are now guarded against during entry.

    #636855 (Bug #66021)
        Swarm would duplicate activity if activity occurred after its
        triggers were provisioned, but before any workers were provisioned.

    #636427 (Bug #65632)
         If the user's ticket expired, an error to be shown the first time
         a page was shown after session expiration.

    #635184 (Bug #65978)
        Browsing files for a project produced 404 errors due to malformed
        URLs in certain environments.

    #634443 (Bug #64376)
        Collapsing comments in inline mode wouldn't work correctly in
        certain scenarios.

    #633171 (Bug #65558)
        Under certain circumstances with user auto-creation, new users
        could not log in, due to the user form-commit trigger not firing;
        Swarm now handles this situation properly.

    #632803 (Bug #65567)
        Swarm would incorrectly display a caret on the review state button
        if you weren't logged in.

    #632794 (Bug #65833)
        The blame button would dissapear when using the view or download
        button in the file browser.

    #631059 (Bug #65790)
        Plain text files were inappropriately syntax-highlighted.

    #630180 (Bug #65549)
        Line numbers could be duplicated in browse files view after
        revisiting the page.

        generate an HTTP-500 error.

    #623461 (Bug #63734)

        keyword did not show in either the opened or closed tabs after
        being approved.

    #618290 (Bug #64976)
        Swarm OVA has PHP timezone hard-coded to America/Los Angeles. This
        causes Swarm to show the incorrect time for events if the OVA runs
        in a different time zone.

    #618219, #624007 (Bug #64760)
